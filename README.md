# ElderAid

> ElderAid is a web-based application for bringing together the elderly and the young in these unprecdented times of COVID-19.

Sometimes we are not always available to care for the elderly and those we love. What about those that are living far away and do not have any support? Walking outside to the supermarket to grab groceries is a health risk, especially for those that are immuno-compromised. There has been many cases of people catching COVID-19 just by going for a grocery run.

This is where our app comes in. What if those elderly and immuno-compromised could have someone to help with groceries, or food? Users could sign-up and login to be able to connect with non-immuno-compromised youth volunteers in their community. The youth would help with a grocery run and mitigate any possible exposure risk that the elderly might face otherwise.
